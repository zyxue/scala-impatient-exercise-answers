This repo hosts my answers to the exercises from the book [Scala for the
Impatient](http://fileadmin.cs.lth.se/scala/scala-impatient.pdf) 1st Edition in
[Jupyter Scala](https://github.com/jupyter-scala/jupyter-scala) format.

I created this repo mainly as a way to get familiar with Scala.

If you find any error or have any suggestion, please feel free to let me know.
